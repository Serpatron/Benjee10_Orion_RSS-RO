# Benjee10_Orion_RSS-RO
Preliminary Configurations for Benjee10s Orion Capsule to be used with Realism Overhaul in KSP. 

REQUIRES RO ENGINES

IMPORTANT:

RealChute Configs are less than perfect. For each mission you will need to select the deploy information in the VAB. Best to double check on the launch pad.

Orion SM RCS do not use Helium but work as intended. Something that can be adjusted. 

All weights should be accurate, however the forward bay cover is probably off the most. It's in the right ballpark for a lack of documentation. 

These configs do *NOT* have RP1 Configurations. Sorry not sorry. They will be added in the future. 

For Kerbalism users, it is REQUIRED that you put an external ECLSS module on the craft to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Preferrably on the CM. Needs to be added to the configs, but for now, this is how it is.
