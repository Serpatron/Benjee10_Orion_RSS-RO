# Benjee10_Orion_RSS-RO
Preliminary Configurations for Benjee10s Orion Capsule to be used with Realism Overhaul in KSP. 

First and foremost, a huge thank you to Benjee10 for creating this wonderful mod and allowing me to publish these configurations. 
It goes without saying that credit for all parts and assets relating to this mod goes to him.

REQUIRES RO_ENGINES

IMPORTANT:

-RealChute Configs are less than perfect. For each mission you will need to select the deploy information in the VAB. Best to double check on the launch pad.

-Orion SM RCS do not use Helium but work as intended. Something that will need adjustment. 

-All weights should be accurate, however the forward bay cover is probably off the most. It's in the right ballpark for a lack of documentation. 

-These configs do *NOT* have RP1 Configurations. Sorry not sorry. They will be added in the future. 

-For Kerbalism users, it is REQUIRED that you put an external ECLSS module on the craft to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Preferrably on the CM. Needs to be added to the configs, but for now, this is how it is. 
-Reentry COM switch isn't great. 

Please feel free to add to these configs with fixes and adjustments.
